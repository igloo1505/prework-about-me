        Hello. My name is Andrew and I'm working to become a developer. Up until
        this point I've been self taught, but with my enrollment in the Trinity
        program I hope to take everything to the next level, and eventually find
        work with a company that challenges me and allows me the opportunity to
        grow and expand.

          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p class="detailsP">
            I was born and raised in Milwaukee, but I did get to travel a bit
            for work in my early to mid twenties. That was an incredible
            experience and something I'll remember forever. It really opened my
            eyes to how people live in other parts of the world, and gave me a
            new appreciation for other cultures.
