      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p class="detailsP">
        Hello. My name is Andrew and I'm working to become a developer. Up until
        this point I've been self taught, but with my enrollment in the Trinity
        program I hope to take everything to the next level, and eventually find
        work with a company that challenges me and allows me the opportunity to
        grow and expand.

          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p class="detailsP">
            I was born and raised in Milwaukee, but I did get to travel a bit
            for work in my early to mid twenties. That was an incredible
            experience and something I'll remember forever. It really opened my
            eyes to how people live in other parts of the world, and gave me a
            new appreciation for other cultures.

          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p class="detailsP">
            In my free time I love to stay active. I enjoy mountain biking and
            working out, but when I have a day off I also love to spend the day
            reading at the lakefront. In college I studied Physics, and although
            it's unlikely I will ever work in that field, I still enjoy staying
            up to date with the latest research.

      <h1>My Dream Job</h1>
      <p class="detailsP">
        I'm looking for a job that will challenge me and allow me to grow. One
        of the main reasons I began to fall in love with development is the
        never ending learning. I intend to truly never stop learning, and would
        love the opportunity to take on tasks that might be outside of my
        comfort zone in the beginning.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I Live</h1>
      <p class="detailsP">
        Currently I live on the lower east side of Milwaukee. I love the
        diversity of the neighborhood and it's vibrance. There's always
        something to do, and you can meet people from all different backgrounds.
