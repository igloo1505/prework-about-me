    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="detailsP">
      Hello. My name is Andrew and I'm working to become a developer. Up until
      this point I've been self taught, but with my enrollment in the Trinity
      program I hope to take everything to the next level, and eventually find
      work with a company that challenges me and affords me the opportunity to
      grow.

          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p class="detailsP">
            I was born and raised in Milwaukee, but I did get a chance to travel a bit
            for work in my early to mid twenties. That was an incredible
            experience and something I'll remember forever. It really opened
            my eyes to how people live in other parts of the world, and gave
            me a new appreciation for different cultures.

          <h1>Hobbies</h1>
          <p class="detailsP">
            In my free time I love to stay active. I enjoy mountain biking and
            working out, but when I have a day off I also love to spend the
            day reading at the lakefront. In college I studied Physics, and
            although it's unlikely I will ever work in that field, I still
            enjoy staying up to date with the latest research.

    <h1>My Dream Job</h1>
    <p class="detailsP">
      I'm looking for a job that will challenge me.

      One
      of the main reasons I love development is that there is so much to learn. I intend to truly never stop being a
      student of some sort, and would
      love the opportunity to take on tasks that might be outside of my
      comfort zone in the beginning.
    </p>
    <h1>Where I Live</h1>
    <p class="detailsP">
      Currently I live on the lower east side of Milwaukee. I love the
      diversity of the neighborhood and it's vibrance. There's always
      something to do, and you can meet people from all different backgrounds.
    </p>
    <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
    <p class="detailsP">
      I love problem solving. Ever since I discovered development a few months
      ago I have been borderline obsessed. Every time I learn something new I
      immediately begin thinking of the next technology I want to learn.
      <br />I have always been fascinated by things powered by logic and
      rationality;whether it was mechanics as a child, physics in college, or
      now development. I would enjoy nothing more than a career that challenges me intellectually.
